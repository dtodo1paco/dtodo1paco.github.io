This is my resume, you can visit it at https://dtodo1paco.github.io/cv/

This is just a simple SPA to have my CV online with the following technologies:
· [React 16](https://reactjs.org/)
· [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) to manage locales
· [bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling
· [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons 
· [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) to get some components done
· [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) to manage my own stylesheets
· [jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test some components (WiP)
· [react-vertical-timeline-component](https://github.com/stephane-monnot/react-vertical-timeline) to create a timeline for work experience and education

Thanks to everybody who offers their components/work/experience free available on the Internet

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
